# colortilt-model
The color induction model (Bachelor Thesis Ibrahim Tunc 2019)

The repository contains the Python scripts used for the modelling. The files in the folder development_scripts are not usable up-to-date, but they are documented to understand the current used scripts if necessary. Each script is commented and documented, in the future the readme-file can be improved by writing what each script does.

# Directories
There are three directory pathways used. First one is to save the figures, second is to save the parameter scan files and the last one is for importing different scripts and the data. The pathway can be changed in the colclass.py pathes class.
