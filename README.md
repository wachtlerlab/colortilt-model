# colortilt-model
The color induction model (Bachelor Thesis Ibrahim Tunc 2019)

The repository contains the Python scripts used for the modelling. The files in the folder development_scripts are not usable up-to-date, but they are documented to understand the current used scripts if necessary. Each script is commented and documented, in the future the readme-file can be improved by writing what each script does.
